# HealthRiskAssessor

This Python code is a program designed to assess an individual's cardiovascular disease risk based on various health factors. It first asks for a password for access. Upon entering the correct password, the user provides personal information like name, age, smoking status, blood pressure, and diet habits. The program calculates a total risk points based on provided criteria and displays a health report indicating the total points, potentially indicating the level of cardiovascular disease risk. The program's structure ensures that sensitive health data is accessed only with the correct password, offering personalized health assessment results.
